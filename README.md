# Baby Project Deployment
This repository serves as a form of documentation and deployment mechanism 
through github actions for how we deploy the Baby Project to a server along with
what security measures we have in place for securing the app and the server(s).

<!-- @TODO: add the deployment structure here once we have on -->
